# Ultimate Prey
Made by Nick Julch

## About
Ultimate Prey is a battle-royale meets party meets survival game. Ultimate Prey is intended to be played multiplayer with a single Host player acting as the lobby leader for other players to connect to. The objective of the game is to find the key and escape the island filled with hunters and other threats. To do so, the players must use these threats against the other players and take advantage of the item chests that spawn across the map. Only one player can escape and be the winner.  

## How to Play
Download the zip file, extract all, and run the .exe for the game.  
Once the game starts, one player will host the lobby and the other players will join them.  
To do this, the Host player will hit the Host button and provide the Client players with their IP address. The host must have Port 7777 forwarded on their router.  
The Client players will enter the Host's IP address into the provided field (defaults to localHost) and hit the Client button to connect.  
All players must click Ready before the Host can click the Start button.  
Once the game starts, players are loaded into the map and must fill in their name and then hit Ready again.  
The objective of the game is to find the key and reach the escape point (canoe) at the other end of the map.  
There are hunters and other island threats in your way. The hunters can see and hear you and will kill you if they catch you.  
The players can find items in chests by bumping into them to collect a random item in the current active item slot (items are overwritten by new ones if the slot is full).  
The players can change item slots by pressing 1, 2, or 3.  
The players can use the active item by pressing F. Information on the item, including its name and ammo are in the bottom left corner of the screen.  
Players can move around the map using WASD, SPACE to jump, and CTRL to sneak.  
If a player picks up the key, they get an indicator above their head and the entire map is notified.  
Players can steal the key in melee range by pressing G.  
If a player dies, a BOOM is heard across the map. If that player had the key, it respawns in a new random location. If all players die the game ends.  
If a player reaches the escape point with the key, the game ends and the winner's name is displayed.
